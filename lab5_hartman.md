## About me ##
This page is to learn a little more about me, Taylor Hartman!

One of my favorite things to do when I have time is to travel. My last big trip I went on was to the United Kingdom. This was one of my all time favorite trips.

Below is a picture from when I went to Paris France.

Something very important to me in my life is my dog Benz. He is a dachshund and the cutest ever. He lives with my parents, so I get very excited to go home and see him.

Below is a picture of us:
